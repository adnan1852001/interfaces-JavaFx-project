- Title: Student Attendance Application.(interfaces-only )

- Goal: The goal of this app is to manage and facilitate the process of taking attendance records and modifying them efficiently.

- Hierarchy:

	> The admin has two major roles: to manage accounts, and courses.

		- For accounts, he can:

			>> Delete a course.
			>> View existing courses.
			>> View students who belong to a specific course.
			>> View the students who didn't attend more than 25% of course lectures. You can export them as an ecxel file. This command is exclusively used after the end of the course.
	

	> The TA has three major roles: to manage lectures, students and attendance.

		- For Lectures, he can:
			>> Create new lecture and add it to a specific course.
